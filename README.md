Project Title: Exon Percentage for PVS1 ACMG.

Description: This code helps with ACMG variant interpretation for PVS1 coding criteria. Using RefSeq ID for the transcript of interest, the code calculates if the exon predicted to be sliced by a variant will remove more or less than 10% of the protein. 

Usage: You can use this code in google colab.
