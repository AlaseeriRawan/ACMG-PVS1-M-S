        "# **What is GTF?**\n",
        "A **GTF** file is a type of text file used in bioinformatics to store and describe gene structure annotations, such as the positions of exons, introns, and other genomic features within a genome.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What is a GTF File?\n",
        "\n",
        "**GTF** is a tab-delimited text file format, and it is widely used to represent gene annotations, particularly in the context of genome assemblies. The GTF format is very similar to the General Feature Format (GFF), but with some specific conventions that make it more suited for certain tasks, especially those involving transcript annotations.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Structure of a GTF File:\n",
        "\n",
        "A GTF file typically contains the following fields, separated by tabs:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **seqname**: The name of the sequence (e.g., chromosome or scaffold) where the feature is located.\n",
        "2. **source**: The name of the program or database that generated the annotation (e.g., Ensembl, HAVANA).\n",
        "3. **feature**: The type of genomic feature (e.g., gene, transcript, exon, CDS).\n",
        "4. **start**: The starting position of the feature on the sequence (1-based indexing).\n",
        "5. **end**: The ending position of the feature on the sequence.\n",
        "6. **score**: A floating-point number representing the confidence or score of the feature (often `.` if not used).\n",
        "7. **strand**: The strand on which the feature is located (`+` for the forward strand, `-` for the reverse strand).\n",
        "8. **frame**: The reading frame of the feature (`0`, `1`, `2`, or `.` if not applicable). This is particularly relevant for coding sequences (CDS).\n",
        "9. **attribute**: A semicolon-separated list of key-value pairs that provide additional information about the feature, such as gene ID, transcript ID, gene name, transcript name, and exon number.\n",
